# COFFEE QUALITY MEASURES PREDICTION

## Overview
This project analyzes an Arabica coffee dataset to identify factors affecting its quality. The analysis focuses on Ethiopia's coffee and examines variables influencing the aftertaste.

## Dataset
- *Source*: Kaggle
- *Attributes*: 44
- *Rows*: 1311

## Objectives
1. Assess the data quality and structure.
2. Clean and preprocess the data.
3. Explore the data through visualizations.
4. Build and evaluate a predictive model.

## Analysis Workflow

### Data Exploration
- Loaded and explored the data using R.
- Visualized distributions of key variables such as Country of Origin and Variety.

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values using mean imputation.
- Removed unnamed or irrelevant categories.

### Visualizations
- Barplots for Arabica producers and quality measures.
- Correlation plots for Ethiopian coffee attributes.

### Model Development
- *Model Used*: Multi Linear Regression
- *Target Variable*: Aftertaste
- *Significant Predictors*: Acidity, Balance, Flavor

## Findings
- Ethiopia's coffee excels in acidity but is lower in aftertaste.
- Balance, flavor, and acidity positively affect aftertaste.
- Sweetness negatively impacts aftertaste.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into improving coffee quality by focusing on specific attributes.
